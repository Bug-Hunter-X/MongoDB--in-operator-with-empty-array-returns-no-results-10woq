# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in MongoDB queries using the `$in` operator with an empty array.  The expected behavior is to return all documents when the array is empty, acting as a no-op. However, MongoDB interprets an empty array as a condition that can't be met, leading to an empty result set.

## Bug Description
The `$in` operator is used to match documents where a field's value is in a specified array.  When the array is empty, the query should ideally return all documents, but instead, it returns no documents.

## Solution
The solution involves checking for an empty array before executing the query. If the array is empty, construct a query that returns all documents.  Alternatively, a conditional approach could be used to modify the query logic when the array is empty.
